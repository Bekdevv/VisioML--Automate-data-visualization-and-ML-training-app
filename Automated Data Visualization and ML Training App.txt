-------------------Automated Data Visualization and ML Training App----------------------------------

Description: A Streamlit-based app that automates data preprocessing, feature engineering,
exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning (ML) model training. Designed to assist
data analysts and ML engineers with end-to-end workflows.

Features:
Dataset upload and preprocessing (cleaning, summarization).
Automated EDA and graph recommendations.
Feature engineering for ML model readiness.
Machine learning algorithm suggestions and automated model training.
Prediction functionality for user queries.

Dataset Guidelines
Minimum Dataset Size:
Rows: At least 10 rows (to ensure meaningful EDA).
Columns: Minimum of 2 columns (one feature, one target).
Maximum Dataset Size:
Rows: Up to 1 million rows for efficient processing with libraries like Pandas or Dask.
Columns: Up to 100 columns (can be adjusted based on system resources).

File Formats Supported:
.csv, .xlsx (Excel), .json.

Limitations:
Avoid datasets with mixed data types in a single column.
File size limited to 100 MB (Streamlit Cloud may have upload restrictions).

Breaking down your project into smaller, manageable tasks is an excellent approach.
Here's a step-by-step flow for implementing your project in a modular fashion:

Phase 1: Foundation
1. Basic Streamlit App Setup
Objective: Create a basic framework for the Streamlit app.
Tasks:
Install dependencies: streamlit, pandas, numpy, etc.
Create a simple file upload interface.
Display the uploaded dataset as a table.
Deliverables:
A Streamlit app that allows users to upload a dataset and view it.


Phase 2: Data Preprocessing Module
2. Data Cleaning
Objective: Automate basic data cleaning tasks.
Tasks:
Handle missing values:
Numerical: Fill with mean/median.
Categorical: Fill with mode or “missing”.
Remove duplicate rows.
Drop constant or low-variance columns.
Deliverables:
A clean dataset displayed in the app.
Logs of cleaning actions performed.

3. Feature Engineering
Objective: Add common feature engineering transformations.
Tasks:
One-hot encode categorical variables.
Scale numerical features using MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler.
Add interaction terms (e.g., multiply or combine columns).
Correlation-based feature selection.
Deliverables:
Cleaned and engineered dataset ready for analysis.


Phase 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Data Summarization
Objective: Provide high-level insights about the dataset.
Tasks:
Display dataset shape, data types, and missing value counts.
Show basic statistics: mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
Generate a textual summary using an AI API like OpenAI's GPT.
Deliverables:
A summary table and text description in the app.

5. Visualization Recommendations
Objective: Suggest appropriate charts/graphs based on data type.
Tasks:
Numerical data: Histograms, box plots, scatter plots.
Categorical data: Bar charts, pie charts.
Mixed data: Correlation heatmaps.
Deliverables:
Interactive visualizations displayed in the app.


Phase 4: Machine Learning Recommendation
6. ML Algorithm Suggestion
Objective: Recommend algorithms based on the dataset.
Tasks:
Analyze target variable type (categorical/continuous).
Suggest suitable algorithms:
Classification: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.
Regression: Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting, etc.
Provide a textual explanation for recommendations.
Deliverables:
A list of recommended algorithms with justifications.

7. Automated Model Training
Objective: Train models on user-selected algorithms.
Tasks:
Allow users to choose the target column.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train selected algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees).
Display model accuracy and performance metrics.
Deliverables:
A trained model with performance metrics shown in the app.


Phase 5: Prediction Module
8. Prediction Interface
Objective: Enable predictions using trained models.
Tasks:
Accept user inputs for prediction through a form.
Predict outputs using the trained model.
Display predictions in a user-friendly way.
Deliverables:
A working prediction interface.


Phase 6: Deployment
9. Deployment
Objective: Deploy the app to make it accessible online.
Tasks:
Choose a deployment platform (e.g., Streamlit Cloud, Heroku).
Package the app with a requirements.txt file.
Create a demo video for GitHub and recruiters.
Deliverables:
A live app accessible through a public URL.


Phase 7: Advanced Features (Optional)
10. Advanced ML Features
Objective: Add future-ready functionalities.
Tasks:
Include unsupervised learning (clustering, PCA).
Support simple neural networks for prediction.
Add hyperparameter tuning options.
Deliverables:
An enhanced app with advanced ML capabilities.
